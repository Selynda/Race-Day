# python-stuff

My first Python program. Learning Python and data science by the seat of my pants is
probably the most appropriate way for me to figure this out. It forces me into the 
language, google, python communities, git communities, etc. until I am completely consumed
and transformed into the total nerd realm of data science

# Project Objective:

The overall objective is to increase knowledge and application of data science techniques
while also learning Python. To accomplish this I have chosen race track data that has to
be extracted from a PDF file of the daily program.

# Project Definition

Step 1: (Active)
Read and interpret a PDF file of a daily race program from Southland Race Park. Manipulate
the text into a readable format for use with data science modeling.

    NOTE: This has by far been the most difficult. The PDF converts quickly and easily; however
    the format is ever changing. Each program is going to require custom tweaking to address
    idiosyncrasies with the way it was created and the conversion to text process. 

Step 2: 
Develop a predictive model based on select historical track information, e.g. race time and 
apply timeseries predictive models.

Step 3: 
Follow on this by using machine learning algoritms to apply a different set of modeling
